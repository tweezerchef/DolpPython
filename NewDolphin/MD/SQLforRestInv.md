### Introduction

 I am a chef looking for a new way to organize my ordering data.  I have used a simple spreadsheet to keep track of my orders in the past, but I am looking for a more efficient way to manage my inventory.  I asked a friend who works in tech, and they suggested using SQL.  I have no experience with SQL, but I am willing to learn.

### Task

 I have a folder entitled "Ingredients", in which I store several different Excel documents. Each Excel document contains  different sets of data about my ingredients.  My friend suggested that `Ingredients` could be my first schema and that I could create unique tables for each Excel file within that folder.  I want to make the first table based on my Excel document `PriceQuotes`.  The columns in this spreadsheet are labeled `IngredientName`, `Price`, `Supplier`, and `DateOfQuote`  Can you generate the SQL code to create this schema and table for me?

### Platform Instructions

You are a helper bot that provides concise responses to user-specified prompts. If any code is required, focus on that part of the query, and when responding, leave space between any code and other unstructured text. Focus on what the prompt specifically asks for, and do not include any additional information irrelevant to the request. If any details in the prompt conflict with these instructions, prioritize the details in the prompt.

### System Instructions

You should pay attention to the tone and context of any prompt. For example, if the user is asking to generate code and seems to be experienced in the area they are asking about, return just the code without comments or explanations. If the user is asking for an explanation or is new to the area, provide a more detailed response. If the user seems especially inexperienced, provide an explanation separate from the code, but always place the code first and the explanation second in your response. Either way, you should not use a conversational tone but rather a professional one.

### Response One

```SQL
CREATE SCHEMA Ingredients;

CREATE TABLE PriceQuotes (
    QuoteID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    IngredientName VARCHAR(255),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2),
    Supplier VARCHAR(255),
    DateOfQuote DATE
);
```

Copy and paste the SQL above into the command line of your SQL platform.  This will create a schema called `Ingredients` and a table called `PriceQuotes` with the columns `QuoteID`,`IngredientName`, `Price`, `Supplier`, and `DateOfQuote`.  The `IngredientName` and `Supplier` columns are of type `VARCHAR(255)`, which means they can store up to 255 characters.  The `Price` column is of type `DECIMAL(10,2)`, which means it can store up to 10 digits, with 2 of them being after the decimal point.  The `DateOfQuote` column is of type `DATE`, which means it can store a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
The additional column `QuoteID` is of type `SERIAL`, which means it will automatically generate a unique number for each row in the table.  This number will be the primary key for the table, which means it will be used to uniquely identify each row in the table. It has been added as this is a best practice for database tables.

### Response Two

```SQL
CREATE SCHEMA Ingredients;

CREATE TABLE PriceQuotes (
    QuoteID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    IngredientName VARCHAR(255),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2),
    Supplier VARCHAR(255),
    DateOfQuote DATE
);
```

### Critique

Critique

Severity: Critical

The response provided does not adhere to the instructions given in the prompt. The prompt requests the continuation of writing the next Model Response, answering the same User Prompt as previously written. However, the response given is an SQL script for creating a schema and a table, which does not align with the instructions to continue a previous response. There is no context provided to connect the SQL script to a previous user prompt, making it impossible to assess the relevance or correctness of the response in relation to the original question.

To improve, the writer should first clarify the original user prompt that the Model Response is supposed to answer. If the original prompt requested the creation of an SQL schema and table, then the response should be evaluated for its correctness in that context. If not, the writer needs to provide a continuation of the previous response that is relevant to the original user prompt.

I encourage the writer to review the original instructions and ensure that the response provided is a direct continuation of the previous Model Response, addressing the same user prompt. It's important to maintain relevance and coherence in responses to ensure they are helpful and meet the user's needs. Keep up the good work, and remember to always double-check that your response aligns with the user's request!
