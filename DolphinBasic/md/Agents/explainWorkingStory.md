### Introduction

I am a high school student interested in computer science, AI, and programming.  I don't have any formal training, but I have built a few small web development projects using standard Typescript/Javascript with standard libraries like Next.js and React.

I am interested in learning more about AI and how to use existing models in my programs. Most people recommended that I start with Python, as it seems to be the language of choice for AI. I understand the basics of JavaScript but not Python and have never written code using Python.

### Task

While researching AI, I started reading about "AI agents" that can help generate more unique and oftentimes more precise output from LLMs. I am interested in learning more about how to build these agents and how to use them to generate stories. What I would like to build is a series of agents that work together to create a story based on a simple prompt. I looked up some examples of similar projects and found the following Python code:

```Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="<INSERTOPENAIKEY>")


class StoryAgent:
    def __init__(self, role, description, character_role="user"):
        self.role = role
        self.description = description
        self.character_role = character_role

    def generate_text(self, prompt, max_tokens=150):
        system_prompt = {"role": "system", "content": prompt}
        character_action = {"role": self.character_role, "content": self.description}

        complete_prompt = [system_prompt, character_action]

        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=complete_prompt,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            temperature=0.7,
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content


def main(prompt):

    hero_agent = StoryAgent("Hero", "a hero with superpowers", "user")
    sidekick_agent = StoryAgent(
        "Sidekick", "a sidekick that often causes trouble", "user"
    )
    narrator_agent = StoryAgent(
        "Narrator", "narrates the story, providing context and background", "assistant"
    )
    evil_agent = StoryAgent("Villain", "a villain with dark powers", "user")
    random_agent = StoryAgent("Random", "a wildcard character", "user")

    agents = [hero_agent, sidekick_agent, narrator_agent, evil_agent, random_agent]

    story = ""
    for agent in agents:
        story_part = agent.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=100)
        story += f"{agent.role}: {story_part.strip()}\n\n"

    print(story)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = input("Enter your story prompt: ")
    main(prompt)
```

### Issue

I ran the program, and it worked. However, the problem is that because I am such a beginner, I don't understand the code at all. I am not technically inclined and have never taken a computer science or programming class, and I want to learn how to create similar programs on my own.

### Task at Hand

I need you to explain the code to me in plain English. Going codeblock by codeblock, please explain specific details as listed below.

1. Explain all Python programming concepts and terms that apply to the code.
2. Explain the purpose of the Open AI library and how it is used in the code.
3. Explain how each invocation of a library function works, what it does, and what it can do in other contexts. Please also explain the Python code in a similar manner.
4. In a sense I would like you to use this code as a starting point to teach me about Python, computer science and large language models.  I would like to understand the code and its concepts as if I were taking a class on the subject.

### Summary

1. Please use a bullet point list to explain all the above details.
2. You should add the block of code (or smaller relevant snippet)  you are explaining or using for the explanation in the bullet point list. Please include it as part of the list, but use markdown to format it as code.
3. Please use plain English and avoid technical jargon as much as possible.  If you must use technical jargon, please explain it in a way a high school freshman could understand.
4. After you have created this explanation, please return it to me. Please do not include the entire original program that I want to be explained, only the explanation in bullet point form.

Best Response:

- **Imports**:

  ```Python
  from openai import OpenAI
  ```

  - The `import` statement imports code from other files or libraries.
  - `openai` is an open-source Python library that makes it easier to interact with the OpenAI models.

- **API Key**:

  ```Python
  client = OpenAI(api_key="<INSERTOPENAIKEY>")
  ```

  - You will need an OpenAI API key to query GPT-3. Create an OpenAI account and add your key inside the quotation marks replacing the text "<INSERTOPENAIKEY>".

- **Classes in Python**:
  - In Python, classes act as containers and blueprints for creating complex data structures holding both data and the methods that operate on that data.

- **Class Definition**:

  ```Python
  class StoryAgent:
  ```

  - `class StoryAgent:` defines a class named StoryAgent.
  - Classes have several key parts:
    - The `class` keyword initiates the code block that defines a new class.
    - The `StoryAgent` is the name of the newly defined class.
    - The colon (:) signifies the beginning of an indented block of code that forms the body of the class.

- **Variables and Data Types**:

  ```Python
      def __init__(self, role, description, character_role="user"):
          self.role = role
          self.description = description
          self.character_role = character_role
  ```

  - `def __init__(self, role, description, character_role="user"):` - is the constructor method of the `StoryAgent` class. It's called whenever a new object of this class is created.
  - `__init__` takes four arguments: self, role, description, and character_role.
    - The `self` reference points back to the current instance or object itself.
    - The `role` argument represents the agent's role in the narrative.
    - The `description` argument provides a brief but informative description of the agent.
    - The `character_role` argument sets how the agent will interact in the narrative, typically either "user" or "assistant".
  - `character_role` is set to a default value of `"user"`. This implies that the created agent will act on behalf of the user by default.
  - The lines `self.role = role`, `self.description = description`, and `self.character_role = character_role` assign the corresponding values passed during object creation to the role, description, and character_role variables of the object.

- **Methods**:

  ```Python
      def generate_text(self, prompt, max_tokens=150):
          system_prompt = {"role": "system", "content": prompt}
          character_action = {"role": self.character_role, "content": self.description}

          complete_prompt = [system_prompt, character_action]

          response = client.chat.completions.create(
              model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
              messages=complete_prompt,
              max_tokens=max_tokens,
              temperature=0.7,
          )

          return response.choices[0].message.content
  ```

  - The `generate_text(self, prompt, max_tokens=150):` method takes two arguments:
    - `prompt`: is a natural language prompt that will guide the GPT-3 model in generating text.
    - `max_tokens`: is the max number of "tokens" (roughly equivalent to words) in the generated response.
  - Inside the codeblock of generate_text():
    - `system_prompt = {"role": "system", "content": prompt}` creates a dictionary, a key-value pair data structure where keys must be strings, called `system_prompt`.
    - In this dictionary, the "role" key corresponds to the string "system," and the "content" key corresponds to the user-provided prompt. This sets up the context for GPT-3's generation: the system will generate text based on the user's prompt.
    - `character_action = {"role": self.character_role, "content": self.description}` creates another dictionary called `character_action`.
    - As before, it holds "role" and "content" keys. In this case, both their values are dynamically set to the current agent's role and description. This will inform GPT-3 about the agent's nature and role when generating text.
    - `complete_prompt = [system_prompt, character_action]` creates a list called complete_prompt. It combines the system_prompt and character_action dictionaries to form a more comprehensive prompt that will be sent to GPT-3.
    - `response = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=complete_prompt, max_tokens=max_tokens, temperature=0.7 )` calls the chat.completions.create() method of the OpenAI client object.
    - Let's break down each parameter passed to the chat.completions.create() method:
      - `model="gpt-3.5-turbo"` - Specifies which GPT-3 model should handle the request. Here, "gpt-3.5-turbo" is used.
      - `messages=complete_prompt` - Passes the constructed complete_prompt list as the input conversation context.
      - `max_tokens=max_tokens` - Sets the maximum number of tokens the model can use in its generated response.
      - `temperature=0.7` - Controls the "creativity" or randomness of the generated text. A lower temperature results in more deterministic responses, while a higher temperature allows GPT-3 to explore more possibilities.
    - The chat.completions.create() method returns a response object containing various details about the generated text, accessible through its attributes.
    - `return response.choices[0].message.content` extracts and returns the actual generated text content from the response object.

- **Code Outside of the Class Definition**:

  ```Python
  def main(prompt):

      hero_agent = StoryAgent("Hero", "a hero with superpowers", "user")
      sidekick_agent = StoryAgent(
          "Sidekick", "a sidekick that often causes trouble", "user"
      )
      narrator_agent = StoryAgent(
          "Narrator", "narrates the story, providing context and background", "assistant"
      )
      evil_agent = StoryAgent("Villain", "a villain with dark powers", "user")
      random_agent = StoryAgent("Random", "a wildcard character", "user")

      agents = [hero_agent, sidekick_agent, narrator_agent, evil_agent, random_agent]

      story = ""
      for agent in agents:
          story_part = agent.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=100)
          story += f"{agent.role}: {story_part.strip()}\n\n"

      print(story)


  if __name__ == "__main__":
      prompt = input("Enter your story prompt: ")
      main(prompt)
  ```

  - `def main(prompt):` defines the main() function, responsible for coordinating interactions and running the program.
  - It takes `prompt` as its argument, which represents the user-provided story prompt.
  - Inside the main() function's codeblock:
    - `hero_agent = StoryAgent("Hero", "a hero with superpowers", "user")` creates an object of the StoryAgent class named hero_agent, setting its role, description, and character_role to the given values.
    - The next four lines similarly create sidekick_agent, narrator_agent, evil_agent, and random_agent objects.
    - `agents = [hero_agent, sidekick_agent, narrator_agent, evil_agent, random_agent]`  creates a list named agents, containing all five StoryAgent objects.
    - `story = ""` initializes an empty string called story, which will serve to store the accumulated narrative as the program progresses.
    - `for agent in agents:` starts a loop that iterates over each agent in the agents list.
    - Inside this loop's codeblock:
      - `story_part = agent.generate_text(prompt, max_tokens=100)` calls the generate_text() method of the current agent object, passing in the story prompt and setting a max token limit of 100.
      - `story_part` will contain the text generated by the agent in response to the prompt.
      - `story += f"{agent.role}: {story_part.strip()}\n\n"` concatenates the agent's role (accessed through agent.role), a colon, the generated text (story_part), and two newline characters (\n\n) to the story string.
      - The strip() method removes unnecessary whitespace from the beginning and end of the generated text.
    - `print(story)` prints the completed narrative, constructed by combining the responses of all the agents, to the console.
  - `if __name__ == "__main__":` checks if this code is being run as the main program.
  - If the condition evaluates to True, the following code is executed:
    - `prompt = input("Enter your story prompt: ")` prompts the user to enter a narrative prompt through the console.
    - `main(prompt)` calls the main() function, passing in the user's prompt as the argument. The program will then proceed to generate and print the narrative as described earlier.
