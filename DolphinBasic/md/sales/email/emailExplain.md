### Introduction

I am a salesperson working for a large company that sells a wide variety of products. Recently, my company sent me a CSV file named `SalesData.csv`. My boss said I should use this data to improve my performance in 2024.

I opened the file up using Google Sheets. I saw the columns `Row ID`, `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Ship Mode`, `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`, `Country`, `City`, `State`, `Postal Code`, `Region`, `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`, `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`.

In each row is a record of every individual sale I closed, with the relevant information for that sale in the appropriate columns. The data begins in 2020 and goes up to the present day in 2024. It looks like a lot of data, and I have no idea how to analyze it. I am not a technically inclined person, I don't know any programming languages, and I have never taken a math class beyond high school algebra.

I asked my friend in the IT department for help, and they recommended that I use the Python programming language to take the data and use it for analysis and other productivity enhancing tasks.

### Program

I asked my friend to create a program that would take all the customer names in the `SalesData.csv` file and send them an email of my choosing. The emails are not listed for the customers, but they all have emails at my company's domain, `mycompany.com`. The emails are their first and last names separated by an underscore with the company domain added after the last name. If there are any special characters in the name, they are removed.

In response, they sent me the code below:

```
import pandas as pd
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
import tkinter as tk

# Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("/media/tom/Linux/Python/DolphinBasic/Sales/SalesData.csv")

# Function to convert customer names to email addresses
def create_email(name):
    # Remove special characters and convert to lowercase
    name = name.replace(" ", "_").replace("'", "").replace("-", "").lower()
    # Create the email address
    return f"{name}@mycompany.com"


# Create a set of unique customer names
unique_customers = df["Customer Name"].unique()

# Create a list of email addresses
email_addresses = [create_email(name) for name in unique_customers]

# Email credentials
sender_email = "sales_guru@mycompany.com"
password = "your_password"

# Create a function to send the emails
def send_emails(email_body):
    # Create a message object
    message = MIMEMultipart()
    message["From"] = sender_email
    message["Subject"] = "Subject of your email"
    message.attach(MIMEText(email_body, "plain"))

    # Create an SMTP server instance
    server = smtplib.SMTP(
        "smtp.mycompany.com", 587
    )  # Replace with your company's SMTP server address and port
    server.starttls()
    server.login(sender_email, password)

    # Send the emails
    for email_address in email_addresses:
        message["To"] = email_address
        server.sendmail(sender_email, email_address, message.as_string())

    # Close the server connection
    server.quit()


# Print a list of customers to whom the email has been sent
print("Email sent to the following customers:")
for name in unique_customers:
    print(name)

# Create a simple GUI with a text box and a button
class EmailSenderApp:
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master
        master.title("Email Sender")

        # Create a text box for the email body
        self.email_body_text = tk.Text(master)
        self.email_body_text.pack()

        # Create a button to send the emails
        self.send_button = tk.Button(
            master, text="Send Emails", command=self.send_emails
        )
        self.send_button.pack()

    def send_emails(self):
        email_body = self.email_body_text.get("1.0", "end-1c")
        send_emails(email_body)


# Create the GUI and run it
root = tk.Tk()
app = EmailSenderApp(root)
root.mainloop()
```

### Issue

I asked my friend to add comments to the code to explain what each part does. As you can see, they did add some comments to the code, but not in a manner that's particularly useful to me, as I am a complete beginner and want to use the comments to understand the code in a way that I can learn from it to create other Python programs in the future. Since they didn't do a very good job explaining in the manner that would be beneficial to me, I would like you to. Here's exactly what I would like you to do:

1. Create an explanation for each block of the code. This explanation should be written as if used in an entry-level programming course that used Python as its teaching language. Explain all keywords, methods, and library invocations, how they work, and how they are used in general. Explain what is going on "underneath the hood" when the program is run. Explain any concepts that would be useful for a beginner with no general computer science knowledge in order to better understand computer science.
2. Under each of these explanations, place the blocks of the code you are explaining in markdown, and if necessary, add inline comments that would help link the code to the text explanation above it. Remove the original comments from the code, as these are not useful to me.
3. Remember, these explanations should be designed to teach me how to write a program like this in the future and understand both Python and programming in general.
4. Return all the explanations and code blocks to me. There is no need to return the code as a working program, just the explanations and the code blocks.
