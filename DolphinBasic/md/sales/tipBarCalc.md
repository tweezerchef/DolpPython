### Introduction

I am a businessperson who works in sales.  Very often, I am required to take potential clients out on the town, and we often end up at a bar.

### Problem

I have a company credit card that I use to take clients out on the town. The issue arises because of some rather arcane rules my company imposes regarding tips.  We are allowed to tip 20%, but only on the pre-tax amount of any bill.  This is a problem because, unlike with restaurants, the sales tax is built into the menu price of the drink at a bar, and I need to be able to calculate the tip on the pre-tax amount of the bill.

### Solution

I need you to generate code in Python to assist me in this task. I am absolutely technically incompetent; however, when I talked to my friend in our IT department, they told me to ask an AI to build this program for me, and they also set up a basic environment for running Python code. I need a program that will take the total amount of the bill and calculate a tip of 20% based on the pre-tax amount. I will summarize the requirements below, and you will create the code for it and return it to me so I can use it.

### Summary of Requirements

1. The program should be written in Python.
2. The program should take the total amount of the bill and the local tax as inputs.  This can be done with a simple prompt.
3. The program should calculate the tip (20%) on the pre-tax amount and return the results (amount of money to tip) to me as its output in a prompt or dialog box.
4. Please ensure the program is well documented so I can understand it.  I am not a programmer, so please ensure it is clear and easy to understand.
5. After you have created this well-documented working code, please return it to me so I can use it.
