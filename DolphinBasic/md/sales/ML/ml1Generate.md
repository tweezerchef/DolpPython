### Introduction

I am a salesperson for a large company that sells a huge variety of products. Recently my company sent me a CSV file `SalesData.cvs`. They said to use this in order to improve my performance.

I opened the file up using Google Sheets and saw the columns `Row ID`, `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Ship Mode`, `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`, `Country`, `City`, `State`, `Postal Code`, `Region`, `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`, `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`. In each row is a record of every individual sale I closed, with the relevant information for that sale in the appropriate columns. The begins in 2020 and goes all the way up to present day in 2024. It looks like a lot of data, and I have no idea how to analyze it.

I asked my friends in the IT department for help, and they recommended that I use the Python programming language to take the data and use it for analysis.

### Task

I really want to use this data in order to have a better 2024 than any other year to date. I would like to incorporate some "machine learning" to do this.  I think a good place to start would be to use machine learning to "predict" which region will have the highest sales in 2024.  I would like you to create the Python code in order to do this.

### Code To Create

1. Generate code in Python that analyzes the sales data and uses machine learning to predict which region will have the highest sales in 2024.  I will be using the `SalesData.csv` as the source of the data. The format of the dates in the CSV is mm/dd/yyyy. The regions are `South`, `East`, and `Central` .
2. The code should output the predicted region along with a visualization of the predicted sales for each region.
3. Use whatever libraries you think are best for this task. I will install them as needed and run the code in Visual Studio Code.
4. Please document the code in a way that allows me to understand how it works and how to use it.
5. Please also create a one to two-paragraph summary of the code.  The documentation can be in the form of comments in the code and can be brief. The summary can cover the rest.
6. Remember that I am a salesperson and not a programmer. My understanding of technology is the level of a high school freshman.
7. Return to me the summary in plain text, followed by the code.
