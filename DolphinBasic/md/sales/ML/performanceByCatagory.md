### Introduction

I am a salesperson for a large company that sells a huge variety of products. I have been using Excel for a long time to track my sales.  Using Excel I have been manually entering my sales data and saving it into a CSV file `SalesData.cvs`.  The Excel sheet has the following columns: `Row ID`, `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Ship Mode`, `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`, `Country`, `City`, `State`, `Postal Code`, `Region`, `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`, `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`.

Recently I have decided I should start analyzing my sales data, and my friend in the IT department recommended that I use the Python programming language to do this. I have no idea how to do this, and I'm not sure where to start, which is where you come in!

### Issue

 I am not an advanced enough user of Excel to really to do any analysis of my sales data. I know my total sales but recently I was thinking it might be useful to break down my sales by product category to see which categories are performing the best. Then I can focus more on those sales. However I have no idea how to do this. However I think this would be a good place to start with my Python analysis.

### Solution

I need you to create a Python program that reads the sales data from the `SalesData.csv` file, filters it by the specified product category, and calculates the total sales amount for that category. The program should then output the total sales amount of each category in a clear, understandable format.

### Summary of Requirements

1. The program should be written in Python and read data from a CSV file named `SalesData.csv`.
2. It should analyze the sales data by product category and calculate the total sales amount for each category.
3. The program should output the results in a clear, understandable format, using whatever libraries you think are best for the task.
4. Ensure the code is well-documented for clarity and ease of understanding by a non-programmer, use inline comments to explain individual blocks of code.
5. Remember I am not a programer so please make sure the code is easy to understand and use. I want to learn from your code, so please explain the code as if you were teaching a highschool student how to use Python.
6. I will be using Visual Studio Code to run the code, so please make sure the code is compatible with that.
