### Introduction

I am a high school student interested in computer science, AI, and programming.  I don't have any formal training but I have built a few small web development projects using standard Typescript/Javascript with standard libraries like Next.js and React.

I am interested in learning more about AI and how to use existing models in my programs. Most people recommended me to start with Python as it seems to be the language of choice for AI.  I've read the very basics about Python but have created very little actual code.

### Task

While researching AI I started reading about "AI agents" that can help in generating more unique and oftentimes more precise output from LLMs. I am interested in learning more about how to build these agents and how to use them to generate stories. What I would like to build is a series of agents that work together to create a story based on a simple prompt. I have been told I can use Python, LangChain and an Open AI API to accomplish this.

### Issue/Code to Generate

I don't have really any idea how to create the program to do this, which is where you come in!  I would like you to generate the code in for this program I have in mind using Python. I am detailing below some key requirements, suggestions and instructions for you to follow. However feel free to fill in the blanks to complete the task as described above.

* Use Python as the language for this code.
* Use LangChain as the library to manage the agents and generate the story.
* Use the Open AI API and its `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` model as the LLM that powers our agents.
* Create five agents that work together to generate a story based on a simple prompt. Those agents should be:
  1. Hero Agent: a character that is the main protagonist of the story and has the powers of a superhero.
  2. Annoying Sidekick Agent: a character that is the sidekick of the hero and is always getting in the way.
  3. Narrator Agent: a character that narrates the story and provides the reader with context and background information.
  4. Evil Agent: a character that is the main antagonist of the story and has the powers of a supervillain.
  5. Random Agent: a character that is a wildcard and can be anything you want it to be.
* The agents will work together to generate a story based on a simple prompt. LangChain will manage the agents and the Open AI API will power the agents.
* In order to limit token usage in your response, please do not comment any of the code, and make it as compact as possible, with no extra lines or spaces, if any explanation is needed place it after the code.
* You may use any other libraries or tools you see fit to complete the task. Please use the most recent version of the libraries and tools you choose.
* Input: a simple prompt that will be used to generate the story.
* Output: a story generated by the agents based on the prompt.
* The input can be a prompt in the console, and the output can be the story printed to the console.
* The story should be at least 500 words long and no more then 2000 words long.
