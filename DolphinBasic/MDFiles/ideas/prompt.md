I'm seeking assistance in creating a Python program for managing customer data for a sales team. The core functionality should include the ability to create, update, and manage customer profiles. Each customer profile should consist of the following information:

Name
Contact Information (e.g., email, phone number)
Purchase History (a list of items purchased)
Preferences (any specific preferences noted during sales interactions)
Requirements:

Data Storage: Recommend a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve this data. Should I use a database, or would a file-based approach (like CSV or JSON) suffice for a smaller scale application?

CRUD Operations: Please provide functions to:

Create new customer profiles, ensuring no duplicate entries based on a unique identifier (e.g., email).
Read or retrieve customer profiles, allowing searches by name or other attributes.
Update existing customer profiles with new information, including adding new purchases to the purchase history or updating contact details.
Delete customer profiles if needed.
User Interface: Outline a simple command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to choose an operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and then prompts for the necessary information based on the choice. Ensure there's feedback to the user after each operation (e.g., "Profile updated successfully").

Data Validation: Include basic data validation, such as checking for valid email formats and ensuring that mandatory fields are not left blank.

Optional: If possible, include a feature to tag customers based on their purchase history or preferences, such as "frequent buyer" or "prefers digital products," to help tailor future sales pitches.

Additional Notes:

The program doesn't need to handle highly sensitive information, but suggestions for basic best practices in data handling would be appreciated.
Keep the implementation simple and focused on functionality, with readability and ease of use as priorities.
Given these requirements, could you provide a Python script outline, including suggested libraries (if any beyond the standard library are needed) and a brief explanation of each part of the code?
