# Introduction

I am a fresh graduate from a Python coding boot camp looking for a job. It's been rough, but I finally got an interview at a local startup my friend is also working at, which is how I got the interview in the first place. I asked my friend about the interview process. They told me it varies from person to person, but in the technical part of the interview, they always use the same coding challenge. Because we live in New Orleans, this challenge makes perfect sense.

### The Challenge

The question is to write a function in Python that does the following:

* Takes as an input a number up to 500
* Counts down from that number to 0
* For each number, print the number and the word "Nawleens".
* If the number is divisible by 7, print the number and the string "Nawleens at the Mardi Gras".
* If the number is divisible by 11, print the number and the string "Nawleens at the Mardi Gras down in the bayou".
* If the number is divisible by 7 and 11, print the number and the string "Nawleens at the Mardi Gras down in the bayou, eat'n that good nutria burgoo".
* If the number is divisible by both 7 and 11, and is even prints the number and the string "Nawleens at the Mardi Gras down in the bayou, eat'n that good nutria burgoo, gyatt thats good".
* If the number is divisible by 10, print the number and the string "New Orleans at Mardi Gras sitting down to eat at a fine meal at Commanders Palace." There is no need to include the word "Nawleens" in the printed string for these numbers.
* This code doesn't have to have a return value. It just needs to print the strings to the console.

### The Issue

* I didn't actually learn anything at boot camp, so I have no idea how to generate a function in Python that does this.

### The Solution

* I need you to generate the code in Python that will fulfill the challenge's requirements.
* Because I will study this code and use it in my interview, I need you to explain the code to me so that I can understand it. Please insert inline comments explaining what exactly each line of code does.
* After you have generated the code and added the comments explaining each line, please return the commented complete code to me.
