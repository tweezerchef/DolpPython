This first line of code creates a function `mardi_gras_countdown`, with the parameter `number` which accepts a number as its argument. The keyword def is the keyword used to create functions. A parameter in a function is a variable that is replaced with a value (referred to as an "argument) when the code is run.

```python
def mardi_gras_countdown(number):
```

 This code block checks if the input number is valid. If the number is greater than 500, the function prints an error message and returns from the function. The keyword `if` is used to check if a condition is true. The keyword `print` is used to display a message to the user. The keyword `return` is used to exit the function and return a value in this case the sentence "Error: Number must be less than or equal to 500."

 ```python
 if number > 500:
        print("Error: Number must be less than or equal to 500.")
        return
```

This section creates a "loop" that will run as long as the number is greater than or equal to 0. The keyword `while` is used to create a loop. The keyword `>=` is used to check if a number is greater than or equal to another number. The keyword `:` is used to indicate the start of a block of code. `output_str` is a variable that is used to store the output string that will be returned once the program finishes running. The keyword `str` is used to convert a number to a string. The `+` operator is used to add strings together.  A string is a sequence of characters, similar to a word or sentence. In this case, the string is the number followed by the word "Nawleens".

```Python
  while number >= 0:
        # Initialize the output string
        output_str = str(number) + " Nawleens"
```

This section checks if the number is divisible by 7, 11, or both. The `%` operator is used to check what the 'remainder' of a number when divided by another. If the number is divisible by 7, the string " at the Mardi Gras" is added to the output string. If the number is divisible by 11, the string " down in the bayou" is added to the output string. If the number is divisible by both 7 and 11, the string ", eat'n that good nutria burgoo" is added to the output string. If the number is also divisible by 2, the string ", gyatt thats good" is added to the output string.

```Python
  # Check if the number is divisible by 7, 11, or both
        if number % 7 == 0:
            output_str += " at the Mardi Gras"
        if number % 11 == 0:
            output_str += " down in the bayou"
        if number % 7 == 0 and number % 11 == 0:
            output_str += ", eat'n that good nutria burgoo"
            if number % 2 == 0:
                output_str += ", gyatt thats good"
```

This section checks if the number is divisible by 10. If the number is divisible by 10, the output string is replaced with a new string that includes the number and the sentence "New Orleans at Mardi Gras sitting down to eat at a fine meal at Commanders Palace."

```Python
 # Check if the number is divisible by 10
        if number % 10 == 0:
            output_str = (
                str(number)
                + " New Orleans at Mardi Gras sitting down to eat at a fine meal at Commanders Palace."
            )
```

This section prints the output string to the console. The keyword `print` is used to display the output string to the user. It then decrements the number by 1. The `-=` operator is used to subtract 1 from the number. Because this is the last line of the loop, the program will then return to the start of the loop and run again with the new value of the number.

```Python

        # Print the output string
        print(output_str)

        # Decrement the number
        number -= 1
```

Finally, the function is called, wich is a term used in computer science for running a function, with the argument 200. This will run the function with the number 200 as the argument. The function will then run and print the output string to the console.

    ```Python
    mardi_gras_countdown(200)
    ```
