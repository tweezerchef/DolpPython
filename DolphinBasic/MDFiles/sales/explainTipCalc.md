### Introduction

I am a businessperson who works in sales.  Very often, I am required to take potential clients out on the town, and we often end up at a bar.

### Problem

I have a company credit card that I use to take clients out on the town. The issue arises because of some rather arcane rules my company imposes regarding tips.  We are allowed to tip 20%, but only on the pre-tax amount of any bill.  This is a problem because, unlike with restaurants, the sales tax is built into the menu price of the drink at a bar, and I need to be able to calculate the tip on the pre-tax amount of the bill.

### Solution

I contacted my buddy in IT and they just sent me this file and said "Use this".  I don't understand what I am supposed to do with it, and I also don't understand what any of the code means, because I have zero experience with programming.  He did say it was written in Python. Below are the contents of that file:

```Python
def calculate_tip(total_bill, tax_rate):

    pre_tax_amount = total_bill / (1 + tax_rate)

    tip = pre_tax_amount * 0.20

    return tip

total_bill = float(input("Enter the total amount of the bill: "))
tax_rate = float(input("Enter the local tax rate as a decimal: "))

tip = calculate_tip(total_bill, tax_rate)

print("The tip amount is:", tip)
```

#### What I Need You To Do

* First please create a brief summary of what the heck I'm supposed to do with this file in order to get it to run on my computer amd do the job I need it to do.
* Second please explain to me what each line of the code is doing, what all the keywords mean, and what they do in the context of the program.
* The first part, the instructions on what to do with the file, please write in standard text/paragraph format.  The second part, the explanation of the code, please write in a bullet point format.
* I am not a programmer and I need this explained to me in a way that I can understand. Do not use any computer science terminology I would be unfamiliar with.  I am a businessperson, not a programmer.
