### Introduction

I am a warehouse manager, and I want to optimize the placement of goods to minimize retrieval time. I have a list of goods with their sizes and retrieval frequencies. The issue is that I'm not knowledgeable in either math or technology. Here are the details of the problem:

The warehouse is divided into a grid with 2 "aisles", A and B. Each aisle is divided into 10 sections. There is a space between each and on all sides of the grid that allows a worker to retrieve items, but there is only one entrance to the warehouse that is on the center bottom edge of the grid.  Each good has a size; they are all the same width, but their height varies from 1-3 height units, and each section can hold a maximum of 4 height units.

Each good has a retrieval frequency, a positive integer indicating the number of times it is retrieved from the warehouse in a given time period. It also has a name, which is a string, an id, which is a positive integer, and a size, which is a positive integer between 1 and 3.

I asked my friend to develop some Python code to help me with this, and a couple of days later, they sent me a file with the following code:

```Python
    def create_placement_plan(goods):
    """
    Creates a placement plan for goods in a warehouse based on how often they are retrieved adn their size

    Input:
    - goods: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains information about a good
             (name, ID, size, retrieval_frequency).

    Output:
    - A dictionary with the good's name as the key and its location as the value.
    """
    # This line creates the sorted list of items in a way that prioritizes
    # frequency and size
    sorted_goods = sorted(goods, key=lambda x: (-x[3], x[2]))

    # placement_plan is an empty space where the plan will go
    placement_plan = {}

    section_height = {
        f"{aisle}{section}": 0 for aisle in "AB" for section in range(1, 11)
    }

    def find_next_section(current_aisle, current_section):
        other_aisle = "B" if current_aisle == "A" else "A"
        for section in range(1, 11):
            for aisle in [current_aisle, other_aisle]:
                if section_height[f"{aisle}{section}"] + size <= 4:
                    return aisle, section
        return None, None

    for good in sorted_goods:
        name, _, size, _ = good
        current_aisle, current_section = find_next_section("A", 1)

        placement_key = f"{current_aisle}{current_section}"
        placement_plan[name] = placement_key
        section_height[placement_key] += size

    return placement_plan

```

### Issue

Although my friend did put a little explanation with the code, I need much more.  I am trying to understand the code, computer science, math and algorithms, and I need this code explained in a way that I can understand.  I need to know what each part of the code does and why it's there.  I also need to know how the code works together to solve my problem.  I would like to understand the code so that I can explain it to others and use it as a starting point to learn more about computer science and programming. I would like every block of code explained to me. Here are some other details about the explanation I would like you to create.

1. Please use a bullet point list to explain all the details listed above.
2. You should add the line or block of code you are explaining or using for the explanation in the bullet point list. Please include it as part of the list but use markdown to format it as code.
3. Please use plain English and avoid technical jargon as much as possible.  If you must use technical jargon, please explain it in a way that a high school freshman could understand.
4. After you have created this explanation, please return it to me. Please do not include the entire original program that I want explained, only the explanation in bullet point form.
