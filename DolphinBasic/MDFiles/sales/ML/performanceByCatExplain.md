### Introduction

I am a salesperson for a large company that sells a huge variety of products. Recently my company sent me this huge CSV file `SalesData.cvs`.

I opened it up using Google Sheets and saw the columns `Row ID`, `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Ship Mode`, `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`, `Country`, `City`, `State`, `Postal Code`, `Region`, `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`, `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`. In each row was a record of every individual sale I closed, with the relevant information for that sale in the appropriate columns. It looks like a lot of data, and I had no idea how to analyze it.

I asked my friend in the IT department for help, and he recommended that I use the Python programming language to take all the data and use it for analysis.

### Code Created by Friend

The first thing I wanted to do was to see how all the different type of products, listed in the `Category` column, were performing by type, so that I could alter my strategies based on the data. I asked my friend to help me, and they gave me this Python program which they said reads the sales data from the `SalesData.csv` file, filters it by the product type in the category column, and outputs a bar chart of the total sales amount for each type, with the exact dollar amount in numerical form as well. Here is that code:

```Python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sales_df = pd.read_csv("SalesData.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")

category_sales_df = sales_df[["Category", "Sales"]]

category_sales_sum_df = category_sales_df.groupby("Category").sum()

category_sales_sum_df = category_sales_sum_df.reset_index()

sns.set_theme(style="darkgrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot(x="Category", y="Sales", data=category_sales_sum_df)
plt.title("Total Sales by Product Category")
plt.xlabel("Product Category")
plt.ylabel("Total Sales")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.tight_layout()

for index, row in category_sales_sum_df.iterrows():
    plt.text(
        index,
        row["Sales"] + 0.01 * category_sales_sum_df["Sales"].max(),
        f"${row['Sales']:.2f}",
        ha="center",
    )

plt.show()

print("\nTotal Sales by Product Category:")
for index, row in category_sales_sum_df.iterrows():
    print(f"  {row['Category']}: ${row['Sales']:.2f}")
```

### Issue

The good news it the code works exactly as expected.  However I don't understand it at all, and I would like to be able to create Python code for data analysis and machine learning by myself in the future.  In order to do this I need you to explain the code, so that I can learn from it.

### Summary of Explanation You Need to Provide

1. I want to understand what each library does and why it is used.
2. I want to understand what each line of code does and why it is used
3. I want to understand how the code works as a whole, and how the different parts of the code work together to create the bar chart and print the sales amounts to the console.
4. When a library is used I what each you to explain what each method in the code does in the context of the code itself and in a broader context so that I can use those methods in the future for different purposes.
5. There is no need to return the actual code to me. Please organize all these explanations in bullet point form, with the code snippet and the explanation in the same bullet point, and return that to me.
