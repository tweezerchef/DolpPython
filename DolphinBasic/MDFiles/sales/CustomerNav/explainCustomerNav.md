### Introduction

I am a salesperson working for a large company that sells a wide variety of products. Recently, my company sent me a CSV file named `SalesData.csv`. My boss said I should use this data to improve my performance in 2024.

I opened the file up using Google Sheets and saw the columns `Row ID`, `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Ship Mode`, `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`, `Country`, `City`, `State`, `Postal Code`, `Region`, `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`, `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`.

In each row is a record of every individual sale I closed, with the relevant information for that sale in the appropriate columns. The data begins in 2020 and goes all the way up to the present day in 2024. It looks like a lot of data, and I have no idea how to analyze it. I am not a technically inclined person, I don't know any programming languages, and I have never taken a math class beyond high school algebra.

I asked my friend in the IT department for help, and they recommended that I use the Python programming language to take the data and use it for analysis and other productivity-enhancing tasks.

### Program

Because of my technical incompetence, I don't know of a way to look for a customer and see all the sales information about them. I asked my friend in IT to make a program for me to do this, and I gave them specific requirements for the program.  Here is the program written in Python they created for me:

```Python
import pandas as pd
from tkinter import Tk, Entry, Frame, Listbox, END, Toplevel
from tkinter import ttk  # Import ttk module for styled widgets

# Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("/media/tom/Linux/Python/DolphinBasic/Data/SalesData.csv")

# Create a tkinter window
root = Tk()
root.title("Sales Data Viewer")
root.geometry("800x600")  # Set initial size of the window

# Styling options for ttk widgets
style = ttk.Style()
style.configure("TLabel", font=("Arial", 10))
style.configure("TButton", font=("Arial", 10))
style.configure("TFrame", background="#f0f0f0")

# Frame for input fields
input_frame = ttk.Frame(root)
input_frame.pack(pady=20)

# Create a label and text field for entering the customer name
ttk.Label(input_frame, text="Customer Name:").grid(row=0, column=0)
name_entry = Entry(input_frame)
name_entry.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=10)


# Function to clear the listbox selection and hide it
def clear_and_hide_listbox(listbox):
    listbox.delete(0, END)
    listbox.place_forget()


# Function to search for the customer data
def search_customer(*args):
    customer_name = name_entry.get()
    customer_data = df[df["Customer Name"] == customer_name]

    if not customer_data.empty:
        display_customer_data(customer_data)
    else:
        ttk.Label(root, text="No data found.", style="TLabel").pack()


# Function to display customer data in a modern table
def display_customer_data(customer_data):
    # Create a new window for displaying results
    results_window = Toplevel(root)
    results_window.title("Search Results")
    results_table = ttk.Treeview(
        results_window, columns=list(customer_data.columns), show="headings"
    )
    results_table.pack(fill="both", expand=True)

    # Configure column headers
    for col in customer_data.columns:
        results_table.heading(col, text=col)
        results_table.column(col, anchor="center")

    # Insert data into the table
    for _, row in customer_data.iterrows():
        results_table.insert("", "end", values=list(row))


# Autocomplete functionality for the text field
def autocomplete(event):
    text = name_entry.get()
    if text:
        matches = [
            name for name in df["Customer Name"].unique() if name.startswith(text)
        ]
        if matches:
            autocomplete_listbox = Listbox(root, height=4)
            autocomplete_listbox.place(relx=0.25, rely=0.05)
            for match in matches:
                autocomplete_listbox.insert(END, match)

            def on_select(event):
                name_entry.delete(0, END)
                name_entry.insert(
                    0, autocomplete_listbox.get(autocomplete_listbox.curselection())
                )
                clear_and_hide_listbox(autocomplete_listbox)

            autocomplete_listbox.bind("<<ListboxSelect>>", on_select)


# Bind events for searching and autocompleting
name_entry.bind("<KeyRelease>", autocomplete)
root.bind("<Return>", search_customer)

# Create a search button
search_btn = ttk.Button(root, text="Search", command=search_customer)
search_btn.pack(pady=10)

root.mainloop()
```

### Issue

I asked my friend to add comments to the code to explain what each part does. As you can see, they did add some comments to the code, but not in a manner that's particularly useful to me, as I am a complete beginner and want to use the comments to understand the code in a way that I can learn from it to create other Python programs in the future. Since they didn't do a very good job explaining in the manner that would be beneficial to me, I would like you to. Here's exactly what I would like you to do:

1. Create an explanation for each block of the code. This explanation should be written as if used in an entry-level programming course that used Python as its teaching language. Explain all keywords, methods, and library invocations, how they work, and how they are used in general. Explain what is going on "underneath the hood" when the program is run. Explain any concepts that would be useful for a beginner with no general computer science knowledge in order to better understand computer science.
2. Under each of these explanations, place the blocks of the code you are explaining in markdown, and if necessary, add inline comments that would help link the code to the text explanation above it. Remove the original comments from the code, as these are not useful to me.
3. Remember, these explanations should be designed to teach me how to write a program like this in the future and understand both Python and programming in general.
4. Return all the explanations and code blocks to me. There is no need to return the code as a working program, just the explanations and the code blocks.
