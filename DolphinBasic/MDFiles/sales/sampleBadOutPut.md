* The problem with the original code is that it calculates the tax amount by multiplying the total bill amount by the tax rate. However, this method includes the tax in the pre-tax amount, which results in an incorrect tip amount.

* To fix the problem, we need to first divide the total bill amount by (1 + tax rate) to get the pre-tax amount. Then, we can calculate the tip amount by multiplying the pre-tax amount by 0.20.

* Here is the corrected code:

```Python
def calculate_tip(total_bill, tax_rate):

    pre_tax_amount = total_bill / (1 + tax_rate)  # Calculate the pre-tax amount by dividing the total bill by the sum of 1 and the tax rate

    tip_amount = pre_tax_amount * 0.20

    return tip_amount


total_bill = float(input("Enter the total bill amount: "))
tax_rate = float(input("Enter the local tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.08): "))

tip_amount = calculate_tip(total_bill, tax_rate)


print(f"The tip amount is: ${tip_amount:.2f}")
```

| Total Bill | Tax Rate | Correct Tip Amount |
|------------|----------|--------------------|
| $100.00    | 8%      | $18.52             |
| $500.00   | 6%     | $94.34             |
| $250.00   | 10%    | $45.45             |
| $75.00    | 7%     | $12.28             |
| $300.00   | 9%     | $50.00             |
