### Introduction

I am a high school student who is interested in programming but has no actual experience or training.  When I asked around, people recommended thinking of a project and just building it using Python.  My grandmother recently became blind, and because she loved reading all the top stories, I decided my project would be to create a program that would read the top stories from the New York Times to her.  I will be using the New York Times top stories API to get the URLs of top stories, Open AI's APIs for text-to-speech and speech-to-text in some instances, and the pyttsx3 library for other text-to-speech instances. I have no idea how to do this, but I am willing to learn.  I have a computer with Python installed, and I am ready to start.

### First Steps

I believe the first step is to create the GUI/window that will open when the program runs and some initial functionality to go along with it.  Below, I will outline some things I think should be included in this initial code.

1. A window that opens when the program runs.
2. The window should contain the buttons 'Record' and 'Send'. There should also be a box for displaying text, which will display both input and output text when the program is running.
3. The 'Record' button or a click of the space bar should stop whatever is being said by the program and allow the user to speak. The 'Send' button or the use of the return key should end a recording in progress and temporally save the results.
4. When the window opens, it should use the pyttsx3 library to say, "Welcome to the New York Times Top Stories Reader. Select from any of the following sections to hear the headlines, arts, automobiles, books/review, business, fashion, food, health, home, insider, magazine, movies, new york region, obituaries, opinion, politics, real estate, science, sports, sunday review, technology, theater, t-magazine, travel, upshot, us, and world. " in a voice that is easy to understand."
5. When the space bar is pressed, the program should stop speaking and start recording the user's voice. If possible, the recording should stop after a few seconds of silence. It should also stop when the user presses the 'Send' button or hits the return key.
6. The program should then send the recording to the Open AI API and get the text of what was said in the recording.  This text should be displayed in the text box in the window when returned and assigned to the variable 'response_text.`  Below is an example of how to call the proper function from the Open AI API to get the text of what was said. In this example, the audio is 'audio.mp3; in the code you generate, it should be the recording that has been temporarily saved.

```Python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file= open("/path/to/file/audio.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
  model="whisper-1",
  file=audio_file
)
print(transcription.text)
```

7. Please respond with the code generated that meets these requirements and any additional code you find necessary to implement this first step in our project. You do not need to add comments to the code; it should be written so that one above my abilities could understand from the code alone.  I will be using VSCode to run the code.
